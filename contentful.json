In the castle he must build and maintain accommodation for the other 8 and their families and animals should they need to retreat. The other 8 would have to do the fieldwork on the land of the permanent soldier and store one third of the harvest in the castle. So, when the enemy comes, the population flees into the castle. There they hide out until the raiding Hungarians have gone back home. Given they have stored one third of last year’s harvest in the castle, the peasants have enough seed to sew the crops for next year. You have to remember that agriculture in the early Middle Ages was extremely inefficient. You needed about 1/3 of the harvest as seed for exit year. That meant when an enemy had raided the countryside and stole or destroyed the entire harvest the peasant not only lost this year’s crop but potentially several years of harvest.

After the battle, Portugal rapidly captured key ports in \nthe Indian Ocean like Goa, Ceylon, Malacca and Ormuz, crippling the \nMamluk Sultanate of Egypt and the Gujarat Sultanate, greatly assisting \nthe growth of the Portuguese Empire and setting its trade dominance for \nalmost a century, until it was taken during the Dutch-Portuguese War and\n theBattle of Swally won by the British East India Company in 1612. It \nmarks the beginning of the European colonialism in Asia. It also marks \nthe spillover of theChristian-Islamic power struggle, in and around the \nMediterranean Sea and the Middle East, into the Indian Ocean which was \nthe most important region for international trade at the time.Since Vasco da Gama arrived in 1498, the Portuguese had been fighting\n Calicut while allying with its local rival Kingdom of Cochin, where \nthey established their headquarters. The northern region of Gujarat, \nmainly Khambhat, was even more important: the Gujarat Sultanate was an \nessential intermediary in east–west trade, between the Red Sea, Egypt \nand Malacca: Gujarati were important middlemen bringing spices from the \nMaluku Islands as well as silk from China, and then selling them to the \nEgyptians and Arabs.In 1505, the King of Portugal, Manuel I, sent his first viceroy, Dom \nFrancisco de Almeida with twenty one vessels to strengthen the fledgling\n Portuguese empire in East Africa and India. When Portugal threatened \nhis field, Sultan Mahmud Begada of Gujarat allied with the Kozhikkodu \nSamutiri (anglicised to Zamorin of Calicut). He then asked his trade \npartners, the Mamluk Sultanate, for help.In 1507, Portuguese forces under command of Afonso de Albuquerque had\n conquered Socotra in the mouth of the Red Sea and, for a short time, \nOrmuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese intervention was seriously \ndisrupting trade in the Indian Ocean, threatening Muslim as well as \nVenetian interests, as the Portuguese became able to undersell the \nVenetians in the spice trade in Europe. The Mamluks and their European \ntrade partners, the Venetians, had become wealthy from monopolizing the \nflow of spices from India to Europe. Venice broke diplomatic relations \nwith Portugal and started to look at ways to counter its intervention in\n the Indian Ocean, sending an ambassador to the Egyptian court. Venice \nnegotiated for Egyptian tariffs to be lowered to facilitate competition \nwith the Portuguese, and suggested that “rapid and secret remedies” be \ntaken against the Portuguese. The sovereign of Calicut, the Zamorin, had\n also sent an ambassador asking for help against the Portuguese.Egyptian Mamluks soldiers had little expertise in naval warfare, and \nPortuguese often attacked and stole supplies of Malabar timber from \nIndia, so Mamluk Sultan, Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri appealed to Ottoman \nsupport. The Ottoman Sultan, Beyazid II – whose navy had helped Spanish \nMoors and Sephardic Jews expelled by the Spanish Inquisition in 1492- \nsupplied Egypt with Mediterranean-type war galleys manned by Greek \nsailors and Ottoman volunteers, mainly Turkish mercenaries and \nfreebooters.These vessels, which Venetian shipwrights helped disassemble\n in Alexandria and reassemble on the Red Sea coast, had to brave the \nIndian Ocean. The galley warriors could mount light guns fore and aft, \nbut not along the gunwales because these cannon would interfere with the\n rowers. The native ships (dhows), with their sewn wood planks, could \ncarry no heavy guns at all. Hence, most of the coalition’s artillery was\n archers, whom the Portuguese could easily outshoot.The Egyptian-Ottoman fleet, whom the Portuguese called under the \ngeneric term the “rumes”, was sent for India to support Gujarat in 1507.\n First they fortified Jeddah against a possible Portuguese attack, it \nthen passed through Aden at the tip of the Red Sea, where they received \nsupport from the Tahirid Sultan, and then, in 1508, crossed the Indian \nOcean to the port of Diu, a city of at the mouth of the Gulf of \nKhambhat.In March 1508, commanded by Mamluk admiral Mirocem (Amir Husain \nAl-Kurdi) or Admiral (Husain Al-Kurdi), the Egyptian Mamluk fleets \narrived at Chaul in India where they surprised a Portuguese fleet \ncommanded by Lourenço de Almeida, son of the Portuguese viceroy. Joined \nby Gujarat admiral Malik Ayyaz, governor of Diu, they fought over three \ndays and won the Battle of Chaul.

The\n Portuguese attempt to establish trade with India would require the \nbreaking of this strongly defended and lucrative trade network. In \naddition to enforcing Portuguese rule, the battle was undertaken as a \npersonal issue by Portuguese viceroy Francisco de Almeida to avenge the \ndeath of his son Lourenço at the hands of the Mirocem (Amir Husain \nAl-Kurdi). He was so enraged at this death that he is supposed to have \nsaid, “He who ate the chick must also eat the rooster, or pay for it”. \nFrancisco de Almeida had rushed to chase the Egyptian fleet because \nAfonso de Albuquerque arrived on 6 December 1508 with orders from the \nKing of Portugal to replace him as the next viceroy.

The \nViceroy ordered most of them to be hanged, burned alive or torn to \npieces by tying them to the mouths of the cannons, in retaliation for \nhis son’s death. Commenting on the battle after winning it, Almeida \nsaid: “As long as you may be powerful at sea, you will hold India as \nyours; and if you do not possess this power, little will avail you a \nfortress on the shore.”Interestingly, after handing over the Viceroy’s \npost to his successor, Dom Afonso de Albuquerque, Almeida left for \nPortugal in November, 1509, and in December, 1509 was himself killed by \nthe Khoikhoi tribe, near the Cape of Good Hope, Africa.This battle did not end the Portuguese-Ottoman rivalry. A second \nnaval battle occurred 30 years later in the Siege of Diu in 1538 when \nthe Turks laid siege with 54 ships to the fortress which was built by \nthe Portuguese in 1535, but then after suffering terrible defeats they \nlifted the siege. Suleiman I the Magnificent sent his admiral Hussein \nPasha for another siege of the fortress at Diu in 1547 which, upon \nfailing, marked the end of Ottoman attempts to expand their influence in\n the Indian Ocean.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"mainPicture":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"sxv5mjgq2061"}},"id":"1rOneWu3yN0FpRsActDUOi","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2022-08-03T15:25:24.955Z","updatedAt":"2022-08-03T15:25:24.955Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"The Battle of Diu","description":"A painting depicting the Portuguese kicking some major ass","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/sxv5mjgq2061/1rOneWu3yN0FpRsActDUOi/bd7fd71bcfdd84049403fef4cb80a710/diu.png","details":{"size":364433,"image":{"width":602,"height":339}},"fileName":"diu.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"id":3,"categories":["battles","history","Portugal","empires","Europe","Asia"]}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"sxv5mjgq2061"}},"id":"42VEpHpbnpltUVK70a2FZL","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2022-08-04T07:31:19.143Z","updatedAt":"2022-08-16T12:42:25.982Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"historyBlog"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"6 Lost Civilizations","author":"By Don Vaughan","publishDate":"2022-08-04T00:00+02:00","content":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"italic"}],"value":"The curation of this content is at the discretion of the author, and not necessarily reflective of the views of Encyclopaedia Britannica or its editorial staff.
